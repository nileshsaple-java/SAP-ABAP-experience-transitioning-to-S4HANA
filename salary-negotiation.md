HR Interview Questions for Negotiations and Strategic Answers

1. Salary Expectations

Q: What are your salary expectations?
Answer:

Strategy: Be confident but reasonable. Base your answer on market trends and your experience.

"Considering my 8 years of experience in SAP across multiple modules, leadership roles, and working with top-tier clients like Deloitte and Accenture, I am expecting a compensation of ₹18–20 LPA, which aligns with industry standards for this role."



If they ask why you deserve this amount:

"My diverse expertise in handling enhancement, integration, rollout, and support projects, combined with my ability to mentor and lead teams, adds significant value to your organization. Additionally, my experience ensures I can contribute to strategic decision-making and deliver results efficiently."

3. Justifying a Higher Salary

Q: Why are you asking for a salary significantly higher than your current one?
Answer:

My current salary is not aligned with the market standards for someone of my experience and skill set. The increase reflects my value addition and the responsibilities I am ready to take on in this role."
